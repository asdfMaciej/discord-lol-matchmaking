# discord-lol-matchmaking
A bot that matchmakes 10 people, basing on their ranks and positions in LoL. Really convenient.

## Usage:
Acquire a bot key from Discord, then place it in the last line. Run the bot and invite the bot to your server. Then configure the lobby, team 1 and team 2 channels. Modify the ranks from PeopleHandler.assign_teams.name1 and name2 as well.
